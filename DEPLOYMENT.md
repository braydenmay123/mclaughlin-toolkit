# McLaughlin Toolkit - Deployment Guide

## Current Status
Your app should now be properly configured for Vercel deployment.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Environment Variable Handling**: Updated `lib/trpc.ts` to handle missing environment variables gracefully
2. **Vercel Configuration**: Added `vercel.json` with proper build settings
3. **API Routes**: Created `api/[...route].ts` for serverless function handling
4. **Error Handling**: Added error boundaries and debugging information

## Deployment Steps

### For Vercel:
1. Your app should automatically deploy when you push to your GitHub repository
2. Vercel will use the `vercel.json` configuration to build your app
3. The build command `npx expo export -p web` will generate the web build
4. The API routes will be handled by Vercel's serverless functions

### Environment Variables (Optional):
If you need to override the API base URL, add this environment variable in Vercel:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com`

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see a white screen:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Visit `/test` on your domain to see if the basic app is working
3. Check Vercel's function logs for API errors
4. Ensure your domain DNS is properly configured

### Common Issues:
- **Build failures**: Check that all dependencies are properly installed
- **API errors**: Verify the backend routes are working at `/api/trpc`
- **Font loading**: The app includes error handling for font loading issues

## Testing
- Visit `https://mclaughlintoolkit.online/test` to verify basic functionality
- Check the main app at `https://mclaughlintoolkit.online/`

## Next Steps
Once the app is working:
1. Test all calculator functions
2. Verify the advisor tools are accessible
3. Check that all navigation works properly
4. Test on mobile devices using the responsive design
